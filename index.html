                    Hi my name is Peng. My superpowers are learning new things and fixing technical and business
                     problems. My story starts in 2009 when I emigrated to America from China to learn how 
                     America works (greatest country/very different from China). <br>
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                     At that time, I had just finished my Bachelors in Business Administration and Agronomy 
                     and Crop Science. Because I wanted to learn about America, I chose to pursue a Masters 
                     of Public Administration. <br>
                </p>     
                <p class="para">
                     After I finished my schooling, I was offered a position as a Loan Processor. A year 
                     later I was promoted into a customer-facing position as a Home Mortgage Consultant. 
                     I excelled at understanding customers’ needs and their qualifications, matching them to 
                     lenders’ requirements, and ensuring their loan applications can get fast and smooth process.<br>

                <p class="para">
                    4 years later, I decided I wanted to serve the country I now called “home”, and, as a side 
                    bonus, I was offered a really cool job learning to maintain the Apache Attack Helicopter.
                     During my time as an Apache Mechanic, I lead a team that maintained Apache’s responsible 
                     for the liberation of Mosul city in 2017. My work included working 13 hour days, 6 days a
                      week, completely disassembling, inspecting, and reassembling Apache aircraft.<br>

                <p class="para">
                    When I returned from Iraq, I was offered the opportunity to work as a system admin to 
                    maintain daily operations for the Apache logbook & logistics software system. During this 
                    time, I taught myself to pull data from SQL and automated reporting that enabled Apache 
                    commanders to proactively track maintenance – saving technicians hours manually pulling 
                    the data every day. <br>

                    After leaving the Army, I decided to pursue my passion for IT. I applied and was accepted 
                    into the MSSA Server and Cloud Administration program. During my time with MSSA, I’ve really 
                    enjoyed learning about scripting with PowerShell and using PowerShell to automate the deployment
                     of different kinds of resources to Azure. I also earned my CCNA Routing and Switching 
                     certification. <br>

                <p class="para">
                    In my downtime, I enjoy learning to be handy with YouTube. Over the years, YouTube has 
                    taught me how to remodel my kitchen, bathroom, floors, build a backyard deck, build a pond,
                     fix my dad’s cars, fix laptops, edit movies, and painting on the wall to make my kid happy. <br>
