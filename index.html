            Hi my name is Peng. My superpowers are learning new things and fixing technical and business
             problems. My story starts in 2009 when I emigrated to America from China to learn how 
             America works (greatest country/very different from China). <br>
        </p>
        <p class=para>
             At that time, I had just finished my Bachelors in Business Administration and Agronomy 
             and Crop Science. Because I wanted to learn about America, I chose to pursue a Masters 
             of Public Administration. <br>

             After I finished my schooling, I was offered a position as a Loan Processor. A year 
             later I was promoted into a customer-facing position as a Home Mortgage Consultant. 
             I excelled at understanding customers’ needs and their qualifications, matching them to 
             lenders’ requirements, and ensuring their loan applications can get fast and smooth process.<br>

            4 years later, I decided I wanted to serve the country I now called “home”, and, as a side 
            bonus, I was offered a really cool job learning to maintain the Apache Attack Helicopter.
             During my time as an Apache Mechanic, I lead a team that maintained Apache’s responsible 
             for the liberation of Mosul city in 2017. My work included working 13 hour days, 6 days a
              week, completely disassembling, inspecting, and reassembling Apache aircraft.<br>

            When I returned from Iraq, I was offered the opportunity to work as a system admin to 
            maintain daily operations for the Apache logbook & logistics software system. During this 
            time, I taught myself to pull data from SQL and automated reporting that enabled Apache 
            commanders to proactively track maintenance – saving technicians hours manually pulling 
            the data every day. <br>
        </p>

            After leaving the Army, I decided to pursue my passion for IT. I applied and was accepted 
            into the MSSA Server and Cloud Administration program. During my time with MSSA, I’ve really 
            enjoyed learning about scripting with PowerShell and using PowerShell to automate the deployment
             of different kinds of resources to Azure. I also earned my CCNA Routing and Switching 
             certification. <br>
        </p>
        <p class=para>
            In my downtime, I enjoy learning to be handy with YouTube. Over the years, YouTube has 
            taught me how to remodel my kitchen, bathroom, floors, build a backyard deck, build a pond,
             fix my dad’s cars, fix laptops, edit movies, and painting on the wall to make my kid happy. <br>
