            Hi my name is Peng. My superpowers are learning new things and fixing technical and business
             problems. My story starts in 2009 when I emigrated to America from China to learn how 
             America works (greatest country/very different from China). <br>

             At that time, I had just finished my Bachelors in Business Administration and Agronomy 
             and Crop Science. Because I wanted to learn about America, I chose to pursue a Masters 
             of Public Administration. <br>
             
             After I finished my schooling, I was offered a position as a Loan Processor. A year 
             later I was promoted into a customer-facing position as a Home Mortgage Consultant. 
             I excelled at understanding customers’ needs and their qualifications, matching them to 
             lenders’ requirements, and ensuring their loan applications can get fast and smooth process.<br>
